scan-s2 requires Linux DVB driver API version 5.0.
The scan-s2 utility was tested with Igor M. Liplianin (liplianin@me.by) DVB S2 API driver changeset 149a5c57c1e2
that can be obtained from: 
http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/s2-liplianin
The sources could be obtained by running:
hg clone http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/s2-liplianin

The driver directory was symbolically linked to "s2" directory. If you have the driver in other directory, 
you'll have to change the following line in Makefile to point to the right place:
INCLUDE=-I../s2/linux/include


If compiler can't find DVB headers in ../s2/linux/include/linux/dvb,
then it looks at usual location /usr/include/linux/dvb.

Install as follows:
	make
	make install
Uninstall
	make uninstall

The scan-s2 utilty can be used to scan channels on currently locked (by szap-s2 utility) channel or
by specifying frequencies list that will be scanned one after another.
szap-s2 utility can be found at:
http://mercurial.intuxication.org/hg/szap-s2

Samples of frequencies files can be found in dvb-s, dvb-t, dvb-c and atsc subdirectories. 
Those files are just samples and defenitelly do not include all frequencies you would like to scan.

NOTE:
Current version was tested with DVB-S/DVB-S2 standard and VDR output only with limited number of options.
Diseqc implementataion tested with 8-to-1 Centurion switch.

usage:
	./scan-s2 [options...] [-c | initial-tuning-data-file]
        -c      scan on currently tuned transponder only
        -v      verbose (repeat for more)
        -q      quiet (repeat for less)
        -a N    use DVB /dev/dvb/adapterN/
        -f N    use DVB /dev/dvb/adapter?/frontendN
        -d N    use DVB /dev/dvb/adapter?/demuxN
        -s N    use DiSEqC switch position N (DVB-S only)
        -S N    use DiSEqC uncommitted switch position N (DVB-S only)
        -i N    spectral inversion setting (0: off, 1: on, 2: auto [default])
		-n		evaluate NIT messages for full network scan (slow!)
        -5      multiply all filter timeouts by factor 5
                for non-DVB-compliant section repitition rates
        -O pos  Orbital position override 'S4W', 'S19.2E' - good for VDR output
        -k cnt  Skip count, will skip every first specified messages for every message type (default 0)
        -I cnt  Scan iterations count (default 10). Larger number will make scan longer on every channel
        -o fmt  output format: 'vdr' (default) or 'zap'
        -x N    Conditional Access, (default -1)
				N=-2  gets all channels (FTA and encrypted), output received CAID :CAID:\n"
                N=-1  gets all channels (FTA and encrypted), output CA is set to :0:
                N=0   gets only FTA channels
                N=xxx sets ca field in vdr output to :xxx:
        -t N    Service select, Combined bitfield parameter.
                1 = TV, 2 = Radio, 4 = Other, (default 7)
        -p      for vdr output format: dump provider name
        -l lnb-type (DVB-S Only) (use -l help to print types) or 
        -l low[,high[,switch]] in Mhz
        -u      UK DVB-T Freeview channel numbering for VDR

        -P do not use ATSC PSIP tables for scanning
            (but only PAT and PMT) (applies for ATSC only)
        -A N    check for ATSC 1=Terrestrial [default], 2=Cable or 3=both
        -U      Uniquely name unknown services


Example of command line:
scan-s2 -5 -o vdr -x 0 -s 2 -S 0 -v -U -O S19.2E dvb-s/Astra-19.2E > channels.conf

In case you experience random missing channels after several scans of the same frequency,
try adding "-k 3" to command line. Some drivers have a buffer and will dump messages from previously
locked channel that have to be ignored.

When sattelite system is used, every frequency will be scanned for DVB-S2 delivery system when DVB-S system
has no results.

For VDR output format type "man 5 vdr"

Special thanks to:
 - Igor M. Liplianin for S2API driver and szap-s2 utility that was used as a reference for scan-s2 utility.
 - Unknown person that posted patch for scan utility that allows sending uncommited diseqc commands.
